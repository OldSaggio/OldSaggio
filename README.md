Ciao! I'm a newbie dev, i studied IT in highschool, attended for 1 year and half Computer Engineering and now i'm a computer science student.
I've created this profile recently and decided to use like a time machine, because i want to view in the future my progress. At the moment you can find many exercises i did during university(C/C++).
My hope is to become a better dev in the future, so i have to work and study hard. Cheers :)
